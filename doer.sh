#Executes tasks written in tasks.txt
#Tasks can be: move, copy, delete, sync.
#The tasks' script can be found in the func.sh script file
#This script can only run in one instance
#Arguments: $1 - the path to the file including the tasks
#			if $1 is missing then the tasks included in tasks.txt get executed
#Examples for calling do.sh:
#	- do.sh
#	- do.sh tasks.txt
#Tasks:
#	-move: 
#		syntax: move [-i] <from dir> <to dir>
#		description: Takes 2 arguments. Moves all of the files from <from dir> to <to dir>
#		options: -i - it runs in interactive mode (asks the user before any operation is executed)	
#		example: move dir1 dir2 (not interactive)
#				 move -i dir1 dir2 (interactive)
#	-copy:
#		syntax: copy [-i] <from dir> <to dir>
#		description: Takes 2 argmuents. Copies all of the files from <from dir> to <to dir>
#		options: -i - it runs in interactive mode (asks the user before any operation is executed)	
#		example: copy dir1 dir2
#				 copy -i dir1 dir2
#	-delete:
#		syntax: delete [-i] <dir>
#		description: Takes 1 argument. Deletes all of the filer in dir
#		options: -i - it runs in interactive mode (asks the user before any operation is executed)	
#		example: delete dir1
#				 delete -i dir1
#	-sync:
#		syntax: sync [-i] [-c] <dir1> <dir2>
#		description: Takes 2 arguments. Synchronizes the two directories. All of the files from dir1 which are not present
#					 in dir2 get copied to dir2 and vice versa.
#		options: -i - it runs in interactive mode (asks the user before any operation is executed)	
#				 -c - it compares the files by content. If this option is missing then the files get compared by name.
